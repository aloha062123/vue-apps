More of the social interaction and events will transfer to VR. Weâ€™re already witnessing the beginning of it with platforms such as Meta Horizon. With improved speech recognition through machine learning, AI avatars in VR will become more responsive and capable of managing virtual social spaces more effectively. This will make virtual interactions more realistic and closer to real life, allowing people to connect, collaborate and socialize in new ways, regardless of their physical location.
