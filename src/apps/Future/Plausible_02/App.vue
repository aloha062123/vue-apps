	Machine learning will make it possible for people to do full real-time translation between languages. Therefore, people will be able to converse with foreigners easily in a virtual space and in a real world with AR. Moreover, with improved machine learning, AI avatars will eventually replace the menu-driven systems for interacting with businesses and organizations in VR. They will be able to understand and respond to a wide range of questions that consumers pose.
