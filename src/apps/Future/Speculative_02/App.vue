	Dunne and Raby envision the present as a point from which the future could unfold in a variety of ways. The further we go into the future, the greater the multiplicity of alternatives. This diagram represents the multiplicity as a set of three nested cones. 
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The outermost cone depicts the realm of the possible, and it includes everything does not negate known physical laws or human limitations. Next comes the plausible, including everything that seems reasonable.The innermost cone shows the probable, what seems likely to occur.
