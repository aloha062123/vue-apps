Enthusiasm for new technologies such as VR can often result in overlooking potential negative impacts on society, the economy, or politics.
One major concern that can arise with the use of AR and VR is the problem of user data collection and monetization. The new forms of data collection proposed by these technologies, such as through wearable devices, are more intrusive than ever before and raise concerns related to "surveillance capitalism" as mentioned by social critic Shoshana Zuboff. The technique was pioneered by Google in the early 2000s and is now being used on a large scale by Amazon and Meta and a smaller scale by numerous other companies.  <br/>
