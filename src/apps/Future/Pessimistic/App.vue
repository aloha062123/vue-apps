Visions offered by enthusiasts for new technologies such as VR generally downplay or overlook entirely the social, economic, or political dangers that the technologies pose now and that may be exacerbated in the future.
  <br/>
   <br/>
The most obvious problem that can arise in the use of AR and VR is the problem of user data collection and monetization. That is because they propose new and much more intrusive ways to collect user data, for instance, via wearable devices. This relates to the issue that social critic Shoshana Zubov (2019) has labeled "surveillance capitalism."  The technique was pioneered by Google in the early 2000s and is now being used on a large scale by Amazon and Meta and on a smaller scale by numerous other companies.
