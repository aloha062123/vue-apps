VR is praised for its ability to transport users to simulated environments. This is especially useful for training purposes as it allows for the creation of realistic training scenarios that might otherwise be difficult or dangerous to replicate in the real world.  For that reason, much research effort and applications shortly will expand for training purposes. To illustrate, it is probable that athletes will be able to practice and improve their skills in VR by simulating various situations and scenarios.   </div>
