The probable future is what is likely to occur unless there are some extreme events. Existing technologies will keep improving and social practices and government and business will continue in their current directions. Therefore, we envision the probable future to be similar to the current situation with AR and VR but with more advanced technologies and devices. For example, VR will have improved graphics processors (GPUs) and more memory to allow for greater photorealistic and more responsive 3D graphical scenes.
<br /><br />
As for AR, it will merge into the general interface for mobile phones. Also, AR glasses will become ubiquitous: Information can wait on the periphery and then float into your field of view as needed, based on your location or what you are working on, just as notifications pop up or slide down now on your computer screen or mobile device.
