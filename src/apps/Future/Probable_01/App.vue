The probable future is what is likely to occur unless there are some extreme events. Existing technologies will keep improving and social practices, government policies, and business strategies will remain in their current directions. Therefore, we can expect the probable future to resemble the present state of AR and VR but with more advanced technologies and devices. For example, VR is expected to have more powerful graphics processors (GPUs) and increased memory for more realistic and responsive 3D graphics.
<br /><br />
As for AR, it is likely that it will become integrated into everyday mobile devices. Also, AR glasses will become commonplace, allowing information to be easily accessible based on a user's location or task, similar to how notifications currently appear on the computer and mobile screens.
