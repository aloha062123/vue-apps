	The probable future is what is likely to occur unless there are some extreme events. We envision the probable future to be similar to the current situation with AR and VR but with more advanced technologies and devices. VR will be adopted as a dominant platform for 3D computer games and smartphones will remain the most important platform for AR for years to come. Eventually, we can predict that AR and VR headsets will converge in the future - with just one device, people will be able to switch between fully immersive or mixed reality views. We can already witness this convergence from the new high-end MR device, Meta Quest Pro.
